# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

My motivation for creating this webpage was to better understand the process of building a webpage. I wanted to further my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I plan to take this knowledge to move myself into the tech field and further my career path. This Prework Study Guide will house notes covering HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It will allow access to information quickly and effectively. During this project I learned, how to navigate GitHub, pull/push repositories, create branches and merge with the main branch. I learned how to add notes/information with HTML, style to my with CSS, and loops in JavaScript.
It is my hope that this webpage continues to grow along side me during my bootcamp with University of Denver.
